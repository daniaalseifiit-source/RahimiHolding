# Deployment & Finalization Checklist ✅

This file contains the final steps to fully finalize, verify, and deploy the site to production.

## 1) Content assets (/content)
- Copy the `/content/` folder (images and static assets) to the site root (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/content/`).
- OR host assets on a CDN and set `VITE_CONTENT_BASE` to the CDN root (e.g., `https://cdn.example.com/content`) and rebuild the site.

PowerShell (to zip dist after build):

```powershell
# From project root after `npm run build`
Compress-Archive -Path dist\* -DestinationPath dist-package.zip -Force
```

## 2) Google Search Console (GSC)
- Option A (HTML file): upload the file `public/google-site-verification-PLACEHOLDER.html` to the site root and rename it to the exact name Google gives you.
- Option B (Meta tag): add `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" />` into `<head>` of `index.html` and rebuild.
- After verification, open Search Console and submit your `sitemap.xml` (usually `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`).

## 3) robots.txt & sitemap.xml
- `public/robots.txt` and `public/sitemap.xml` are generated by `npm run generate-sitemap` (already wired into `prebuild`/`postbuild`).
- Ensure sitemap is reachable at `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`.

## 4) Contact form reliability
- For reliable deliverability, enable SMTP on the server and install PHPMailer via Composer:
  1. `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`
  2. Set env vars in hosting control panel: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_SECURE` (tls|ssl), `SMTP_FROM` (optional), `SMTP_FROM_NAME` (optional).
- If Composer is not possible on your server, `contact.php` will fall back to PHP's `mail()`.

## 5) Security & HTTPS
- Make sure HTTPS is enabled and valid SSL certificate in place.
- The `.htaccess` includes HSTS and other security headers; verify they are compatible with your host (some shared hosts manage headers differently).

## 6) Final QA checklist
- Test the contact form in production and confirm email arrives.
- Visit `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml` and preview it.
- Verify Open Graph previews by using Facebook/Twitter Card validators.
- Verify the site in Google Search Console and submit the sitemap.
- Test desktop/mobile view and make sure images load from the right `CONTENT_BASE`.

## 7) Editorial
- Farsi and Arabic translations are in place but recommended to run a final editorial pass for tone and correctness.

## 8) Optional: CDN
- Upload `/content` to a CDN and set `VITE_CONTENT_BASE` to the CDN URL, then run `npm run build` to bake the CDN URLs into the site.

If you'd like, I can help with any of these steps: uploading assets, building with a CDN base, or adding your GSC token and re-building the verification file for you.
